    <h1>Israeli Water Infrastructure Attack</h1>

    <h3>
      <b><u>Description:</u></b>
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Occurred in April of 2020.</li>
      <li>Linked to Iranian group: CyberAv3ngers</li>
      <li>
        In two rural districts, Iranian hackers attacked computers that control
        water flow and wastewater treatments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attack attempted to poison the water by increasing chlorine levels in
        water going to residential areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also sought to trigger fail-safe which would shut down pumps to leave
        thousands without water during heatwave.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pumps went into continuous operation, wiped out information,
        irregularities due to unplanned changes in data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ultimately no damage was done (minor issues in local water systems).
      </li>
      <li>
        Israel retaliated by launching a cyberattack on an Iranian port,
        attempting to harm the economy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Was first modern attack on civilian infrastructure from Iran to Israel.
      </li>
    </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Many facilities use default passwords so it was easy for hackers
                to gain access.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <b>Exploited known vulnerabilities:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hackers are able to manipulate systems remotely by gaining
                access through devices with unpatched vulnerabilities.
              </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Manipulated programmable logic controllers to increase chlorine
            levels and prevent water from being distributed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Program logic controllers are physical devices in the facility that
            are essential to automate processes in water treatment and
            distribution systems.

    <h3>
      <b><u>Legal Concerns:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <b>International Law Considerations:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Use of Force:</b>
          Attempting to poison water supplies and disrupt critical
          infrastructure could potentially be considered a use of force under
          international law.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>State Responsibility:</b>
          If conclusively attributed to Iran, the attack could be considered a
          violation of international law. However, the challenges of attribution
          in cyberspace often allow states to maintain plausible deniability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Domestic and International Criminal Law:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Cybercrime:</b>
          The hackers' actions violate Israeli cybercrime laws, including
          unauthorized access to computer systems and attempted sabotage of
          critical infrastructure.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Terrorism:</b>
          Given the potential for mass civilian casualties, the operation could
          potentially be classified as cyber terrorism under some legal
          frameworks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Laws of Armed Conflict:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Distinction:</b>
          Targeting civilian water supplies raises concerns about the principle
          of distinction between military and civilian targets in armed
          conflict.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Proportionality:</b>
          The potential harm to civilians from water poisoning could be
          considered disproportionate to any military objective.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Human Rights Law:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Water:</b>
          Attempting to disrupt water supplies could be seen as a violation of
          the human right to clean water and sanitation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>State Practice and Cyber Norms:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Responsible State Behavior:</b>
          The operation contravenes emerging norms of responsible state behavior
          in cyberspace, including refraining from attacking critical
          infrastructure in peacetime.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Countermeasures and Self-Defense:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Proportionate Response:</b>
          Israel's retaliatory cyberattack on an Iranian port raises questions
          about the legality and proportionality of countermeasures in
          cyberspace.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Implications for International Security:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Escalation Risks:</b>
          Such operations against critical civilian infrastructure could lead to
          dangerous escalation between states.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

              <li>
                Monitor network traffic in real-time to detect suspicious
                behavior or any unauthorized access attempts.
              </li>
              <li>
                This should be implemented as a high priority for any systems
                directly controlling critical infrastructure.
              </li>
              <li>

                administrative tools to ensure that access cannot be easily
                gained.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additional verification, such as a onetime passcode or
                biometrics, is required to gain access instead of using just a
                username and password.
              </li>
              <li>
                Credentials can still be stolen, but it is harder to gain access
                due to the second method of authorization required.

              <li>
                Iran was able to gain control through remote access â€“ this could
                prevent similar future attacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                A physical attack (such as a USB drop) would be the only way to

      <b><u>Legal Concerns:</u></b>
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <b>International Law Considerations</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Self-Defense:</b>
          Under international law, Israel's defensive measures must align with
          the right to self-defense as outlined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>State Responsibility:</b>
          Israel must ensure that its defensive actions do not infringe on the
          sovereignty of other states. Attribution of the attack to a state
          actor like Iran requires clear evidence to justify any retaliatory
          measures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Domestic Legal Frameworks:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Data Protection and Privacy:</b>
          Implementing tools such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
          (IDPS) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) involves processing
          potentially sensitive data. These measures must comply with Israeli
          data protection laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Critical Infrastructure Protection:</b>
          Israeli laws governing critical infrastructure security mandate robust
          defenses against cyber threats. The use of air-gapped systems for
          critical infrastructure aligns with these requirements by preventing
          unauthorized remote access.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Human Rights Considerations:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Access to Water: </b>
          The attack's potential impact on water supply raises human rights
          concerns regarding access to clean water. Defensive measures must
          ensure that such essential services are protected from disruption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Industry Standards and Best Practices:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Security Standards Compliance: </b>
          Implementing cybersecurity tools must adhere to industry standards and
          best practices, ensuring that systems are adequately protected against
          known vulnerabilities and threats.
