    <p><b>Inroduction</b></p>
    
    <p>
      The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was established in April of 1979. 
      We have several cyber divisions operating under our name. The Electronic
       Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization (EWCD), the Intelligence 
       Organization (IO), Cyber-Electronic Command (CEC), and the Basij Cyber
        Council. We are led by Hossein Salami and operate under the Supreme leader.  
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The IRGC is committed to defending the Islamic Republic’s values, ideology,
      and sovereignty. In an era of rapidly evolving threats, we are at the front
      of defending Iran from adversaries who seek to undermine its sovereignty.
      The IRGC protects both the physical and digital boarders of Iran. In addition
      to defending our cyberspace, the IRGC’s offensive cyber capabilities enable 
      s to deter and neutralize adversaries who attempt to harm our national 
      interests through cyber warfare.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      We have many talents working within our agency. We recruit anyone who 
      has the skills that can benefit our cause. Our espionage and sabotage 
      groups are in need of more operatives to help our mission. We may be in 
      competition with the Ministry of Intelligence; however, we do collaborate
      when needed. 
    </p>
    <br/>
       <b>Signed,</b><p>Hossein Salami and the Surpreme Leader Ali Khamenei</p>
