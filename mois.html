    <p><b>Welcome to the Ministry of Intelligence and Security!</b></p>
    
    <p>
    Established in 1983, The Ministry of Intelligence is in charge
    of multiple cyber groups. Our leader is Esmaeil Khatib and we
    serve under the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. At the 
    Ministry of Intelligence, we are committed to protecting the 
    nationâ€™s security and sovereignty.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        One of our many purposes is to collect, analyze, produce, 
        and categorize internal and external intelligence. MOIS 
        has played a crucial role in maintaining the stability 
        and integrity of the Islamic Republic by detecting and
        neutralizing both internal and external threats.
