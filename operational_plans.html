    <h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Operation 1:</b></h1>
    <h1>Hackers Breach Israeli Nuclear Facility's Computer Network</h1>

    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An Iran-linked hacking group breached the network of an Israeli nuclear
        installation as a protest against the war in Gaza. They claim to have
        stolen and published thousands of documents. While many of the documents
        stolen were not sensitive in nature, the leaked phone numbers, email
        addresses, and more could be used maliciously in future attacks.
      </li>
      <li>Breached the Dimona nuclear facility.</li>
      <li>Done by Anonymous hackers.</li>
      <li>
        Part of a series of data dumps carried out against Israel by various
        threat groups.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      <b><u>Offensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b>
    </h3>

    <p>
      In this context, the goal of the Iranian hackers was to infiltrate the IT
      network, exfiltrate sensitive data, and release it without disrupting the
      operational technology (OT) network. This type of operation is typically
      part of an intelligence-gathering and disinformation campaign. While the
      disruption of the OT was not the goal, it very easily could have been, and
      could have been disastrous if exploited.
    </p>

    <h4><b>Offensive Cyber Tools/Weapons:</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <p><b>Spear Phishing Toolkits:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purpose:</b> Used to craft highly targeted phishing emails that
          exploit specific individuals or groups within the organization to gain
          network access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Function:</b> By embedding malicious links or attachments, the
          attackers can execute remote access or data exfiltration once a user
          is compromised.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Custom Malware (e.g., Data Exfiltration Malware)</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purpose: </b>To extract sensitive data from the compromised network
          without detection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Function: </b>The malware is designed to remain stealthy,
          communicate with command and control (C2) servers, and exfiltrate
          sensitive documents over time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Lateral Movement Tools (e.g., Mimikatz) </b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purpose: </b>To escalate privileges and move laterally within the
          IT network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Function: </b>After gaining initial access, tools like Mimikatz
          help attackers gain further control by stealing credentials, which can
          be used to access sensitive systems and databases.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Legal Issues:</b></h4>
    <h5><b>International Law Considerations:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Use of Force:</b>
        The scale and effects of the cyber operation, including the theft of
        sensitive data and potential impact on critical infrastructure, may
        reach the threshold of an armed attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>State Responsibility:</b>
        If the Iranian government is proven to be behind the attack, it could be
        held responsible for violating international law. However, attribution
        in cyberspace is difficult, allowing states to maintain plausible
        deniability.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>Domestic Legal Frameworks:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Criminal Law:</b>
        The hackers' actions likely violate Israeli cybercrime laws, including
        unauthorized access to computer systems and theft of data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>National Security Laws:</b>
        The targeting of a nuclear facility implicates national security
        concerns. Israeli authorities may invoke special powers to respond to
        the threat.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Espionage and Intelligence Activities:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>State Practice:</b>
        While espionage is generally not prohibited by international law, the
        methods used (hacking and data theft) may violate domestic laws.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Countermeasures:</b>
        Israel may consider taking proportionate countermeasures in response,
        which could include retaliatory cyber operations against Iranian
        targets. However, these must comply with international law principles of
        necessity and proportionality.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Human Rights and Privacy:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Data Protection:</b>
        The theft and publication of personal data raise privacy concerns.
        Israel may have obligations under domestic and international law to
        protect the privacy of affected individuals.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Implications for Nuclear Safety:</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>IAEA Safeguards:</b>
        The breach of a nuclear facility could potentially impact Israel's
        ability to meet its nuclear safety and security obligations. This may
        require reporting to and cooperation with the International Atomic
        Energy Agency.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Related Offensive Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data:</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Tools: </b>Phishing kits, malware creation frameworks, penetration
        testing tools (e.g., Metasploit for exploit development).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Techniques:</b>Social engineering, exploiting unpatched
        vulnerabilities, data exfiltration methods, credential harvesting, and
        lateral movement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Technology: </b>Encrypted C2 channels, VPNs for anonymity, and the
        dark web for selling or distributing the leaked data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data: </b>Sensitive documents, personal identifiable information
        (PII) of facility personnel, facility schematics, or other classified
        data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- DEFENSIVE -->
    <h3>
      <b><u>Defensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <p>
      To protect against similar operations, an Israeli facility would need to
      develop a cybersecurity strategy that protects its IT network, monitors
      for threats, and ensures the OT network remains isolated from cyber
      threats. This strategy would implement the below tools and strategies, as
      well as other basics such as a zero trust policy, reduced physical access,
      and basic antivirus.
    </p>

    <h4><b>Defensive Cyber Tools/Weapons:</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <h5><b>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</b></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purpose: </b>To detect and block suspicious activity in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Function: </b> IDPS can identify malicious activity such as
          abnormal traffic, unauthorized access, or malware communications, and
          automatically block threats.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5><b>Network Segmentation Tools:</b></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purpose:</b>To isolate sensitive networks like the OT network from
          potential attack vectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Function: </b>By segregating IT and OT environments, attackers
          would find it much harder to move laterally and affect critical
          systems even if the IT network is compromised.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5><b>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):</b></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Purpose: </b>To monitor endpoints (workstations, servers) for
          malicious behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Function: </b>EDR continuously scans for indicators of compromise
          (IoCs), including malware, abnormal process behavior, and privilege
          escalation attempts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>
        <b>Related Defensive Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data: </b>
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Tools: </b>Firewalls, VPNs, multi-factor authentication (MFA),
          Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Techniques: </b>Segmentation of IT/OT networks, anomaly detection,
          patch management, penetration testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Technology: </b>Use of AI/ML for threat detection, encryption
          protocols to protect data, forensic tools to analyze breaches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data: </b>Logs from firewalls, IDPS systems, and SIEM platforms
          that provide real-time information on potential threats and past
          attack indicators.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Legal Issues:</b></h4>
    <ul>
      <b>Compliance with National Legislation:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Data Protection:</b>
          The use of monitoring tools like Intrusion Detection and Prevention
          Systems (IDPS) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) must comply
          with Israel's Protection of Privacy Law (PPL). These systems collect
          and process data, potentially including personal information, which
          requires adherence to data protection principles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cybersecurity Obligations:</b>
          The new Temporary Law on Handling Severe Cyberattacks imposes specific
          obligations on digital service providers. This includes reporting
          severe cyberattacks to authorized agencies and following their
          instructions for cyber defense.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Government Oversight and Intervention:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Mandatory Reporting:</b>
          Under the new law, the facility may be required to report
          cybersecurity incidents to government agencies.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Government Access: </b>Authorized agencies may request access to
          the facility's systems and data for cybersecurity purposes. This must
          be balanced against privacy rights and conducted within legal
          boundaries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>International Law Considerations:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Use of Force:</b>
          While these defensive measures are unlikely to constitute a use of
          force under international law, any active countermeasures must be
          carefully considered to avoid escalation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>State Responsibility:</b>
          Israel must ensure that its cybersecurity practices, even when
          implemented by private entities, do not violate international law.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Sector-Specific Regulations:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Critical Infrastructure: </b>
          If the facility is considered critical infrastructure, it may be
          subject to additional regulations under the Regulation of Security in
          Public Bodies Law, which authorizes specific agencies to issue binding
          directives.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Privacy and Civil Liberties:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Employee Privacy:</b>
          The use of EDR and other monitoring tools must be balanced against
          employee privacy rights. Clear policies and consent procedures may be
          necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Minimization:</b>
          Tools collecting data must adhere to the principle of data
          minimization, collecting only what is necessary for cybersecurity
          purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Liability and Due Diligence:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Standard of Care:</b>
          Implementing these defensive measures may be considered part of the
          standard of care for cybersecurity. Failure to do so could potentially
          lead to liability issues in case of a breach.

    <ul>
      <b>International Law Considerations</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Self-Defense:</b>
          Under international law, Israel's defensive measures must align with
          the right to self-defense as outlined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>State Responsibility:</b>
          Israel must ensure that its defensive actions do not infringe on the
          sovereignty of other states. Attribution of the attack to a state
          actor like Iran requires clear evidence to justify any retaliatory
          measures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Domestic Legal Frameworks:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Data Protection and Privacy:</b>
          Implementing tools such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
          (IDPS) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) involves processing
          potentially sensitive data. These measures must comply with Israeli
          data protection laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Critical Infrastructure Protection:</b>
          Israeli laws governing critical infrastructure security mandate robust
          defenses against cyber threats. The use of air-gapped systems for
          critical infrastructure aligns with these requirements by preventing
          unauthorized remote access.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Human Rights Considerations:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Access to Water: </b>
          The attack's potential impact on water supply raises human rights
          concerns regarding access to clean water. Defensive measures must
          ensure that such essential services are protected from disruption.

      <b>Industry Standards and Best Practices:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>

    <h3>
      <b><u>Description:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Iranian government-sponsored APT actors had been exploiting
        vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet products to gain
        initial access to systems across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure
        sectors, including Transportation, Healthcare and U.S. municipal
        government. The actors could potentially leverage this access for
        follow-up operations like data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, and
        extortion. This has occurred from March 2021 until about November 2021.
      </li>
      <li>
        In March of 2021, the FBI and CISA observed Iranian government-sponsored
        APT actors scanning devices on ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for Fortinet
        FortiOS vulnerability CVE-2018-13379.
      </li>
      <li>
        In May 2021, these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors exploited a
        Fortigate appliance to access a webserver hosting the domain for a U.S.
        municipal government.
      </li>
      <li>
        This goal of this campaign was to have initial access to potential
        exploit a system further in the future.

    <p><b>International Law Considerations:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Use of Force:</b>
        The attacks on water facilities and other critical infrastructure could
        potentially be considered a use of force under international law. This
        raises questions about the legality of such actions under the UN
        Charter.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>State Responsibility:</b>
        If conclusively attributed to Iran, these attacks could be considered
        violations of international law norms prohibiting intervention in the
        internal affairs of other states and the obligation to respect the
        sovereignty of other nations.
      </li>

    <p><b>Laws of Armed Conflict</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Distinction:</b>
        Targeting civilian infrastructure like water facilities and hospitals
        raises concerns about compliance with the principle of distinction
        between military and civilian targets.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Proportionality:</b>
        The potential impacts on civilian populations from disrupting critical
        infrastructure could be considered disproportionate to any military
        objective.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Cybercrime Laws:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Domestic and International Cybercrime Statures:</b>
        The unauthorized access of computer systems, data theft, and deployment
        of ransomware likely violate numerous domestic and international
        cybercrime laws.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Human Rights Law:</b></p>
    <ul>

        <b>Responsible State Behavior:</b>
        These operations contravene emerging norms of responsible state behavior
        in cyberspace, particularly those prohibiting attacks on critical
        infrastructure during peacetime.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Countermeasures and Self-Defense:</b></p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <p><b>Espionage Considerations:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>State Practice:</b>
        While espionage itself is not generally prohibited under international

    </ul>

    <p><b>Use of Force and Self-Defense:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Threshold and Armed Attack:</b>
        Defensive measures must not cross the threshold of "use of force" under
        international law unless the original attack reaches the level of an
        "armed attack," justifying self-defense under Article 51 of the UN
        Charter.

      ESET Research: Iran-OilRig group (Helix Kitten) deployed new malware to
      its Israeli victims, collecting credentials
    </h1>

    <br />

    <p>
      <b>Actor(s): </b>Oilrig (COBALT GYPSY, IRN2, APT34, Helix Kitten, Evasive
      Serpens, Hazel Sandstorm, EUROPIUM)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What did they do? </b>Held two campaigns with a undiscovered backdoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Who did the attack: </b>Various Israeli healthcare sectors, a
      manufacturing company, and a local governmental organization.
    </p>
    <p><b>Type of Attack: </b>Cyberespionage and credential theft.</p>
    <p><b>1st Campain Caught - September 2023: </b>Credential Theft</p>
    <p>
      <b>2nd campaign Caught - December 2023: </b>Actions on systems
      (downloaders)
    </p>

    <h3>
      <b><u>Description:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Oilrig began the campaign (Solar) by hacking into a legitimate webserver
      to use it as a C2 (c&c) server to run undiscovered backdoors after being
      compromised typically through email phishing. The c2 server allows Iranian
      hackers to access the systems without looking like suspicious network
      activity. Doing this allowed them to also install a multitude of different
      post-compromise tools that allow for extraction of data. During the first
      campaign Oilrig mostly focused on stealing data from Windows Credential
      Manager and from major browsers, credentials, cookies and browsing
      history.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Compromise they began a second operation closely related to Solar
      where they used four lightweight but highly adaptable downloaders;
      SampleCheck5000, ODAgent, OILcheck, and OILBooster. Although relation of
      the two compromises hasn't directly been linked, we can assume that the
      same actors attacked both as all data breaches during the second operation
      were all previously compromised by Oilrig. Like they did previously during
      the Solar campain, they used malicious emails, but this time using
      legitimate cloud storage and cloud-based email services most of which come
      from Microsoft. Notable compromises included; Microsoft Graph OneDrive,
      Outlook APIs’, and Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <b><u>Tools Used:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>ODagent: </b>
        (similar to OilRig’s Marlin backdoor) Uses the Microsoft OneDrive API
        for C&C communications. However, ODagent was specifically made to
        specialize in downloading and executing various payloads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OILboost: </b>
        like ODAgent, it uses Microsoft one drive, but the difference is in they
        use the API to access OneDrive accounts instead of a compromised Outlook
        account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Samplecheck5000 (SC5k): </b>
        Is used to download and execute OilRig tools using the Office Exchange
        Web Services instead of OneDrive. However, it was updated to now
        obsfiscate analysis and add new new exfiltration functionality. This
        downloader (Last seen 2023) has been updated to v3.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OILcheck:</b>
        Based on SC5k v3. Uses the same methods to extract commands hidden in
        messeges, but the difference being is uses Microsoft graph for
        communication instead of Microsoft exchange mail
      </li>

      </ul>

      <h5><b>Cyber Operation Legality:</b></h5>

      <p><b>International Law Considerations</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Sovereignty:</b> The operation likely violates the sovereignty of
          Israel and that of potentially other countries. Unauthorized access to
          computer systems in foreign territories is generally considered a
          breach of sovereignty under international law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Non-intervention:</b> The campaign could be seen as an unlawful
          intervention in the internal affairs of the targeted states,
          particularly given its focus on critical sectors like healthcare and
          government.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Use of Force and Armed Attack</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Threshold:</b> While primarily focused on espionage, the
          operation's potential to disrupt critical infrastructure could
          potentially cross the threshold of "use of force" under international
          law.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>State Responsibility</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Attribution:</b> Iran could be held responsible under international
          law if the operation is conclusively attributed to state actors or
          proxies acting under its direction or control.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Cybercrime Laws</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Domestic and International Statutes:</b> The activities described
          likely violate numerous domestic and international cybercrime laws.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Human Rights Law</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Privacy Rights:</b> The extensive data collection and surveillance
          aspects of the operation may infringe on individual privacy rights
          protected under international human rights law.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Espionage Considerations</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>State Practice:</b> While espionage itself is not explicitly
          prohibited under international law, the methods used (hacking, data
          theft) violate domestic laws of the target states.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Countermeasures and Self-Defense</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Proportionate Response:</b> The targeted states may consider
          proportionate countermeasures or, if the effects are severe enough,
          potentially invoke the right to self-defense.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Sector-Specific Regulations</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Healthcare and Critical Infrastructure:</b> Targeting healthcare
          and other critical sectors may violate specific international
          agreements protecting these areas from cyber attacks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5><b>Summary:</b></h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The offensive strategy leverages tools like Cobalt Strike, which is
          used to craft sophisticated phishing campaigns and deploy stealthy
          malware. The Merlin C2 Platform or Covenant C2 enables the attackers
          to establish hidden communication channels using domain fronting
          techniques. Meanwhile, modular tools from Metasploit and Empire
          facilitate data exfiltration by adapting to different defensive
          measures.

      <h5><b>Cyber Operation Legality:</b></h5>

      <p><b>International Law Considerations</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Sovereignty and Non-Intervention:</b> Israel's defensive measures
          must respect the sovereignty of other nations and adhere to the
          principle of non-intervention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Due Diligence:</b> Under international law, Israel has a duty to
          ensure its territory is not used for cyber operations that harm other
          states. This includes implementing robust cybersecurity measures to
          prevent its systems from being exploited for attacks against other
          countries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Domestic Legal Frameworks</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Data Protection and Privacy Laws:</b> The deployment of tools such
          as network traffic analysis and anomaly detection must comply with
          Israeli data protection laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cybersecurity Regulations:</b> Israel's national cybersecurity
          framework mandates specific protective measures for critical
          infrastructure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Human Rights Considerations</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Privacy Rights:</b> Defensive measures involving monitoring and
          data collection must balance security needs with individual privacy
          rights, ensuring compliance with both domestic and international human
          rights standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>International Cooperation</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Information Sharing:</b> Effective defense against cyber threats
          often requires international cooperation. Israel's strategy may
          involve sharing threat intelligence with allies, which must be
          conducted in accordance with international agreements and protocols.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Proportionality and Necessity</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Defensive Measures:</b> Any defensive actions taken must be
          proportionate to the threat posed and necessary to protect national
          security interests.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Cyber Norms and Best Practices</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Responsible State Behavior:</b> Israel's defensive strategy should
          align with emerging norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace,
          including transparency, accountability, and respect for international
          law.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5><b>Summary:</b></h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The defensive approach uses tools like Azure Active Directory
          Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust principles, ensuring that
          every access request is continuously verified. Darktrace or Vectra AI
          monitors network activity in real time, identifying anomalies that may
          indicate an ongoing attack. Finally, CanaryTokens or ShadowPlex deploy
          deceptive elements, providing an early warning system while gathering
          intelligence on attackers.
