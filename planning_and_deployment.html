      <b><u>Definition:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%">
      One of the significant challenges affecting a country's ability to conduct
      cyberwarfare planning and deployment is the difficulty of cyber
      attribution—the ability to identify with certainty who is behind a
      cyberattack. This challenge is exacerbated when adversaries deliberately
      employ psychological warfare by planting false flags to mislead
      attribution, creating confusion, and undermining trust in decision-making
      processes. The following steps can be taken to ensure Iran has the best
      chance of success when engaging in offensive cyber missions.

    <h3>
      <b><u>Overview:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%">
      For many nation-states, especially Iran, social engineering is a heavily
      sought after tactic due to how it “preys on the fact that humans are the
      weakest link in information security” (Saylor Academy). For every cyber
      system, humans are responsible for maintaining and securing them. However,
      humans are very prone to being manipulated into giving away keys to
      confidential information through the exploitation of their trust and
      emotions, proving to be the most effective method of breaching as there is
      no complete foolproof way to prevent this from ever happening, with as
      much as “84% of organizations” falling “victim to a social engineering
      attack” in 2022 (La Salle University, 2024). Social engineering can also
      be extended to not just target general individuals in an organization, but
      to high-profile individuals through the usage of spear phishing or
      watering holes attacks.

      Russian hackers launched an espionage campaign against the embassies of
      Georgia, Poland, Ukraine, and Iran beginning in 2023. Hackers exploited a
      bug in a webmail server to inject malware into servers at the embassies
      and collect information on European and Iranian political and military
      activities.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%">
      As a nation facing persistent cyber challenges, Iran must remain vigilant
      against the ever-evolving threat of nation-state cyber espionage and
      warfare. These threats jeopardize critical national security, economic
      stability, and public trust by targeting our military infrastructure,
      nuclear initiatives, and vital industries. In response to these
      challenges, Iran has developed a comprehensive plan to mitigate risks and
      fortify its cyber defenses at every stage of a potential cyber
      engagement—before, during, and after an attack. (Pieper, 2012)

          Our Incident Response (IR) process is immediately activated upon

          to regain control of our systems. Although these are good tatics
          during the initial attack, we must continuously monitor the network

          also prevent reintrusion from any backdoors left in the system. (FTC,

      It is our responsibility to ensure the safety of our nation’s critical
      infrastructure for both the country and its citizens’ sake. Attacks
      utilizing viruses have the potential to cripple our infrastructure for
      long periods of time, severely affecting our ability to function as a
      nation. The following plan should be put in place in case of similar
      attacks.
