    <h1 style="text-align:center">IRAN DOCTRINE</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:center">Our nation's doctrine constitutes the following:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Asymmetric Warfare</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iran views cyberattacks as part of its asymmetric military capabilities to 
                confront more powerful adversaries. This allows Iran to project power despite limitations in its conventional military forces. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Organizational Structure</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iran has created a sophisticated organizational structure to manage cyber conflict, including:</li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)</li>
                <li>The Basij, a civilian paramilitary organization</li>
                <li>The Passive Defense Organization (NPDO)</li>
                <li>The Supreme Council of Cyberspace for coordination </li> 
              </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>Defensive and Offensive Capabilities</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iran focuses on both protecting its own infrastructure and developing offensive cyber capabilities. 
                The country has a cyber defense system called NIN (National Information Network) to thwart attacks.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Use of Proxies</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iran often leverages third parties and proxy groups to carry out cyberattacks, making attribution more difficult. 
                This aligns with Iran's general preference for using ambiguity in achieving its policy goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Retaliation and Deterrence</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iran sees cyberattacks as part of a continuum of conflict and uses them for retaliation against perceived threats.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Intelligence Gathering</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iran conducts cyber espionage operations to collect intelligence on adversaries and dissidents.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Domestic Control</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Cyberwarfare capabilities are used internally for surveillance and control of Iran's own population.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Proportionality</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Iranian cyber retaliation tends to be proportionate in scale to the perceived offense. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Integration with Broader Strategy</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Cyberwarfare is viewed as part of Iran's broader "soft war" military strategy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
