    <h1>Iran'a Doctrine Page:</h1>
    <p>Iran's cyberwarfare doctrine can be characterized by the following key elements:</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>Asymmetric warfare:</strong>
        Iran views cyberattacks as part of its asymmetric military capabilities to confront more powerful adversaries. This allows Iran to project power despite limitations in its conventional military forces. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Organizational structure:</strong>
        Iran has created a sophisticated organizational structure to manage cyber conflict, including: 
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)</li>
          <li>The Basij, a civilian paramilitary organization</li>
          <li>The Passive Defense Organization (NPDO) </li>
          <li>The Supreme Council of Cyberspace for coordination </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Defensive and offensive capabilities:</strong>
          ran focuses on both protecting its own infrastructure and developing offensive cyber capabilities. The country has a cyber defense system called NIN (National Information Network) to thwart attacks. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use of proxies:</strong>
          Iran often leverages third parties and proxy groups to carry out cyberattacks, making attribution more difficult. This aligns with Iran's general preference for using ambiguity in achieving its policy goals. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retaliation and deterrence:</strong>
          Iran sees cyberattacks as part of a continuum of conflict and uses them for retaliation against perceived threats. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intelligence gathering:</strong>
          Iran conducts cyber espionage operations to collect intelligence on adversaries and dissidents. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Domestic control:</strong>
          Cyberwarfare capabilities are used internally for surveillance and control of Iran's own population. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proportionality:</strong>
          Iranian cyber retaliation tends to be proportionate in scale to the perceived offense. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integration with broader strategy:</strong>
          Cyberwarfare is viewed as part of Iran's broader "soft war" military strategy. 
        </li>
      </li>
