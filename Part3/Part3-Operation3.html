    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Operation 3</b></h1>
    <h3><b><u>Description:</u></b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Iranian government-sponsored APT actors have been exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft 
    Exchange and Fortinet products to gain initial access to systems across multiple U.S. critical 
    infrastructure sectors, including Transportation, Healthcare and U.S. municipal government. 
    The actors leverage this access for follow-on operations like data exfiltration, ransomware 
    deployment, and extortion. This has been occurring since March 2021 until the time of this 
    report (November 2021).
        </li>
        <li>
            In March of 2021, the FBI and CISA observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors 
            scanning devices on ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for Fortinet FortiOS vulnerability 
            CVE-2018-13379. 
        </li>
        <li>In May 2021, these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors exploited a Fortigate 
            appliance to access a webserver hosting the domain for a U.S. municipal government. </li>
        <li>This goal of this campaign was to have initial access to potential exploit a system 
            further in the future.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Legal Issues:</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            These offensive operations and tactics violate international cyber laws. 
            These tools and techniques were used against critical U.S. infrastructure, 
            which is criminalized by international and domestic law. Because the threat 
            actors are outside of the U.S, they are not punishable by U.S. law. Iran is 
            not a part of NATO, and so Iran cannot be held responsible for broken laws 
            by NATO either. However, it is important to note that this is a grey area 
            due to the difficulty in definitively attributing a cyber attack to a group 
            or country. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Related Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data:</b></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Task Scheduler modifications for persistence.</li>
        <li>Creation of new user accounts for maintaining access.</li>
        <li>Use of legitimate tools for data collection and exfiltration.</li>
        <li>FTP transfers over port 443 for data exfiltration.</li>
        <li>Exploiting Fortninet Devices</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><b><u>Defensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Detection Systems:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Investigate Microsoft Exchange servers for compromise.</li>
            <li>Search for potential changes in firewall, RDP, and WinRM settings that may allow attackers back in.</li>
            <li>Review directories for new user accounts.</li>
            <li>An IDS or IPS can also be implemented</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Patch Management:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>install new patches and updates.</li>
            <li>Specifically patch software affected by the CVE mentioned earlier.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>Network Segmentation:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Segmentate the network to prevent lateral movement.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Multi-Factor Authentication:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Use MFA to help protect accounts with access to critical systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Phishing Awareness:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            Use meetings or emails to spread awareness for phishing attempts.
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <h4><b>Legal Issues:</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Defensive measures such as the ones outlined in this plan, do not violate 
            any legal measures in the cyber world. These measures are to be put in place 
            to protect against those who do break the law.  </li>
    </ul>
