    <h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Operation 3: </b></h1>
    <h1>Iranian Attackers Breach US Critical Infrastructure</h1>

    <h3>
      <b><u>Description:</u></b>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Iranian government-sponsored APT actors had been exploiting
        vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet products to gain
        initial access to systems across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure
        sectors, including Transportation, Healthcare and U.S. municipal
        government. The actors could potentially leverage this access for
        follow-up operations like data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, and
        extortion. This has occurred from March 2021 until about November 2021.
      </li>
      <li>
        In March of 2021, the FBI and CISA observed Iranian government-sponsored
        APT actors scanning devices on ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for Fortinet
        FortiOS vulnerability CVE-2018-13379.
      </li>
      <li>
        In May 2021, these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors exploited a
        Fortigate appliance to access a webserver hosting the domain for a U.S.
        municipal government.
      </li>
      <li>
        This goal of this campaign was to have initial access to potential
        exploit a system further in the future.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Legal Issues:</b></h4>

    <p><b>International Law Considerations:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Use of Force:</b>
        The attacks on water facilities and other critical infrastructure could
        potentially be considered a use of force under international law. This
        raises questions about the legality of such actions under the UN
        Charter.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>State Responsibility:</b>
        If conclusively attributed to Iran, these attacks could be considered
        violations of international law norms prohibiting intervention in the
        internal affairs of other states and the obligation to respect the
        sovereignty of other nations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Laws of Armed Conflict</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Distinction:</b>
        Targeting civilian infrastructure like water facilities and hospitals
        raises concerns about compliance with the principle of distinction
        between military and civilian targets.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Proportionality:</b>
        The potential impacts on civilian populations from disrupting critical
        infrastructure could be considered disproportionate to any military
        objective.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Cybercrime Laws:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Domestic and International Cybercrime Statures:</b>
        The unauthorized access of computer systems, data theft, and deployment
        of ransomware likely violate numerous domestic and international
        cybercrime laws.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Human Rights Law:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Right to Water and Health:</b>
        Attacks on water systems and healthcare facilities could be seen as
        violations of fundamental human rights to water, sanitation, and health.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>State Practice and Cyber Norms:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Responsible State Behavior:</b>
        These operations contravene emerging norms of responsible state behavior
        in cyberspace, particularly those prohibiting attacks on critical
        infrastructure during peacetime.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Countermeasures and Self-Defense:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Proportionate Response:</b>
        The attacks could potentially justify proportionate countermeasures.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Espionage Considerations:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>State Practice:</b>
        While espionage itself is not generally prohibited under international
        law, the methods used (hacking, data theft) likely violate domestic laws
        of the target state.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>Creation of new user accounts for maintaining access.</li>
      <li>Use of legitimate tools for data collection and exfiltration</li>

    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Detection Systems:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Investigate Microsoft Exchange servers for compromise.</li>
        <li>
          Search for potential changes in firewall, RDP, and WinRM settings that
          may allow attackers back in.
        </li>
        <li>Review directories for new user accounts.</li>
        <li>An IDS or IPS can also be implemented</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Patch Management:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>install new patches and updates.</li>
        <li>
          Specifically patch software affected by the CVE mentioned earlier.

      <ol type="a">
        Use meetings or emails to spread awareness for phishing attempts.

    </ol>

    <h4><b>Legal Issues:</b></h4>

    <p><b>Domestic Legal Authority:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Act:</b>
        This law authorizes CISA to coordinate and implement cybersecurity
        measures to protect federal civilian networks and critical
        infrastructure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Domestic Legal Authority:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Act:</b>
        This law authorizes CISA to coordinate and implement cybersecurity
        measures to protect federal civilian networks and critical
        infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>National Defense Authorization Act:</b>
        Provides legal basis for the Department of Defense to conduct cyber
        operations to defend against foreign threats to US interests.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>International Law Considerations:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Sovereignty:</b>
        Defensive measures must respect the sovereignty of other nations.
        Actions that impact systems in other countries could violate this
        principle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Due Diligence:</b>
        The US has an obligation under international law to exercise due
        diligence in preventing its territory from being used for cyber
        operations that affect the rights of other states.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>State Responsibility:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Attribution::</b>
        The US must have sufficient evidence to attribute the attacks to Iran
        before taking any countermeasures.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Use of Force and Self-Defense:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Threshold and Armed Attack:</b>
        Defensive measures must not cross the threshold of "use of force" under
        international law unless the original attack reaches the level of an
        "armed attack," justifying self-defense under Article 51 of the UN
        Charter.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Human Rights Law:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Privacy and Data Protection:</b>
        Defensive measures involving monitoring and data collection must balance
        security needs with privacy rights and data protection laws.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Cybercrime Laws:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Budapest Convention:</b>
        US actions should align with international cybercrime treaties, which
        provide frameworks for international cooperation in cybercrime
        investigations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Proportionality and Necessity:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Countermeasures:</b>
        Any defensive actions that could be considered countermeasures must be
        proportional to the injury suffered and necessary to induce compliance
        with international law.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Critical Infrastructure Protection</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Sector-Specific Regulations:</b>
        Defensive actions in specific sectors must comply with sector-specific
        regulations and standards.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Public-Private Partnerships:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Information Sharing:</b>
        Legal frameworks like the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act govern
        how the government can share threat intelligence with private sector
        entities.
      </li>
    </ul>
