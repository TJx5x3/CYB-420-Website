    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Operation 1:</b></h1>
    <h1>Hackers Breach Israeli Nuclear Facility's Computer Network</h1>

    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An Iran-linked hacking group breached the network of an Israeli nuclear installation 
            as a protest against the war in Gaza. They claim to have stolen and published thousands 
            of documents. While many of the documents stolen were not sensitive in nature, the leaked 
            phone numbers, email addresses, and more could be used maliciously in future attacks. </li>
        <li>Breached the Dimona nuclear facility. </li>
        <li>Done by Anonymous hackers. </li>
        <li>Part of a series of data dumps carried out against Israel by various threat groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b><u>Offensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b></h3>

    <p>In this context, the goal of the Iranian hackers was to infiltrate the IT network, exfiltrate 
        sensitive data, and release it without disrupting the operational technology (OT) network. This
         type of operation is typically part of an intelligence-gathering and disinformation campaign. 
         While the disruption of the OT was not the goal, it very easily could have been, and could 
         have been disastrous if exploited.   </p>

    <h5><b>Spear Phishing Toolkits:</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Purpose:</b> Used to craft highly targeted phishing emails that exploit specific individuals or 
            groups within the organization to gain network access. </li>
        <li><b>Function:</b> By embedding malicious links or attachments, the attackers can execute remote access or 
            data exfiltration once a user is compromised. </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Custom Malware (e.g., Data Exfiltration Malware)</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To extract sensitive data from the compromised network without detection. </li>
        <li><b>Function: </b>The malware is designed to remain stealthy, communicate with command and control (C2) 
            servers, and exfiltrate sensitive documents over time. </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Lateral Movement Tools (e.g., Mimikatz) </b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To escalate privileges and move laterally within the IT network.  </li>
        <li><b>Function: </b>After gaining initial access, tools like Mimikatz help attackers gain further control 
            by stealing credentials, which can be used to access sensitive systems and databases.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Related Offensive Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data:</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tools: </b>Phishing kits, malware creation frameworks, penetration testing tools (e.g., Metasploit for exploit development). </li>
        <li><b>Techniques:</b>Social engineering, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, data exfiltration methods, credential harvesting, and lateral movement. </li>
        <li><b>Technology: </b>Encrypted C2 channels, VPNs for anonymity, and the dark web for selling or distributing the leaked data. </li>
        <li><b>Data: </b>Sensitive documents, personal identifiable information (PII) of facility personnel, facility schematics, or other classified data. </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3><b><u>Defensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b></h3>
    <p>To protect against similar operations, an Israeli facility would need to develop a cybersecurity strategy that
         protects its IT network, monitors for threats, and ensures the OT network remains isolated from cyber threats.
          This strategy would implement the below tools and strategies, as well as other basics such as a zero trust 
          policy, reduced physical access, and basic antivirus.  </p>
    
    <h4><b>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To detect and block suspicious activity in real-time.</li>
        <li><b>Function: </b>By segregating IT and OT environments, attackers would find it much harder to move laterally and affect critical systems even if the IT network is compromised. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):</b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Purpose: </b>To monitor endpoints (workstations, servers) for malicious behavior. </li>
        <li><b>Function: </b>EDR continuously scans for indicators of compromise (IoCs), including malware, abnormal process behavior, and privilege escalation attempts.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Related Defensive Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data: </b></h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tools: </b>Firewalls, VPNs, multi-factor authentication (MFA), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. </li>
        <li><b>Techniques: </b>Segmentation of IT/OT networks, anomaly detection, patch management, penetration testing. </li>
        <li><b>Technology: </b>Use of AI/ML for threat detection, encryption protocols to protect data, forensic tools to analyze breaches.  </li>
        <li><b>Data: </b>Logs from firewalls, IDPS systems, and SIEM platforms that provide real-time information on potential threats and past attack indicators. </li>
    </ul>
