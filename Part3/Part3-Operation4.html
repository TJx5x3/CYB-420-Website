    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Operation 4 && Operation 4.5:</b></h1>
    <h1>ESET Research: Iran-OilRig group (Helix Kitten) deployed new malware to its Israeli victims, collecting credentials </h1>

    <br/>
    
    <p><b>Actor(s):  </b>Oilrig (COBALT GYPSY, IRN2, APT34, Helix Kitten, Evasive Serpens, Hazel Sandstorm, EUROPIUM)</p>
    <p><b>What did they do? </b>Held two campaigns with a undiscovered backdoors.</p>
    <p><b>Who did the attack: </b>Various Israeli healthcare sectors, a manufacturing company, and a local governmental organization.</p>
    <p><b>Type of Attack: </b>Cyberespionage and credential theft.</p>
    <p><b>1st Campain Caught - September 2023: </b>Credential Theft</p>
    <p><b>2nd campaign Caught - December 2023: </b>Actions on systems (downloaders) </p>

    <h3><b><u>Description:</u></b></h3>
    <p>Oilrig began the campaign (Solar) by hacking into a legitimate webserver to use it as a C2 (c&c) server to run undiscovered 
        backdoors after being compromised typically through email phishing. The c2 server allows Iranian hackers to access the 
        systems without looking like suspicious network activity.  Doing this allowed them to also install a multitude of different 
        post-compromise tools that allow for extraction of data. During the first campaign Oilrig mostly focused on stealing data 
        from Windows Credential Manager and from major browsers, credentials, cookies and browsing history.  </p>

    <p>After Compromise they began a second operation closely related to Solar where they used four lightweight but highly adaptable 
        downloaders; SampleCheck5000, ODAgent, OILcheck, and OILBooster. Although relation of the two compromises hasn't directly 
        been linked, we can assume that the same actors attacked both as all data breaches during the second operation were all 
        previously compromised by Oilrig. Like they did previously during the Solar campain, they used malicious emails, but this 
        time using legitimate cloud storage and cloud-based email services most of which come from Microsoft. Notable compromises 
        included; Microsoft Graph OneDrive, Outlook APIs’, and Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services. </p>

    <h3><b><u>Tools Used durring this Campaign</u></b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>ODagent: </b>
            (similar to OilRig’s Marlin backdoor) Uses the Microsoft OneDrive API for C&C communications. However, ODagent was 
            specifically made to specialize in downloading and executing various payloads. 

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>OILboost: </b>
            like ODAgent, it uses Microsoft one drive, but the difference is in they use the API to access OneDrive accounts 
            instead of a compromised Outlook account.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Samplecheck5000 (SC5k): </b>
            Is used to download and execute OilRig tools using the Office Exchange Web Services instead of OneDrive. However, 
            it was updated to now obsfiscate analysis and add new new exfiltration functionality. This downloader (Last seen 
            2023) has been updated to v3. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>OILcheck:</b> 
            Based on SC5k v3. Uses the same methods to extract commands hidden in messeges, but the difference being 
            is uses Microsoft graph for communication instead of Microsoft exchange mail 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b><u>Offensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b></h3>
    <ul>
    <h5><b>Custom Phishing Campaign Engine with Dynamic Payload Generation:</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Tool: </b>
            Gophish or Cobalt Strike 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Purpose:</b>
            Automate the crafting and distribution of phishing emails with embedded malicious payloads that can adapt 
            based on the target’s system. Cobalt Strike, in particular, is popular among adversaries for its 
            flexibility in creating payloads and managing phishing campaigns. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Stealth C2 Infrastructure with Domain Fronting Capabilities:</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Tools: </b>
            Merlin C2 Platform or Covenant C2 Framework 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Purpose:</b>
            Set up a command-and-control (C2) server using domain fronting 
            to blend malicious traffic with legitimate communications. 
            These C2 tools can disguise traffic through trusted domains, 
            making it difficult for defenders to distinguish between normal 
            and malicious activities. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Modular Data Exfiltration Malware with Adaptive Capabilities:</b></h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Tool: </b>
            Gophish or Cobalt Strike 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Purpose:</b>
            Use modular malware to deploy adaptive backdoors that can extract 
            credentials, cookies, and browsing history based on conditions. 
            Empire’s PowerShell scripts can stay dormant and trigger based on 
            specific network conditions. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5><b>Cyber Operation Legality:</b></h5>
    <p>The offensive strategy leverages tools like Cobalt Strike, which is used 
        to craft sophisticated phishing campaigns and deploy stealthy malware. 
        The Merlin C2 Platform or Covenant C2 enables the attackers to establish 
        hidden communication channels using domain fronting techniques. 
        Meanwhile, modular tools from Metasploit and Empire facilitate data 
        exfiltration by adapting to different defensive measures </p>

    </ul>

    <h3><b><u>Defensive Cyber Strategy:</u></b></h3>
    <ul>
        <h5><b>Zero Trust Architecture:</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Tool: </b>
                Microsoft Azure Active Directory Conditional Access or Okta 
                Identity Cloud 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Purpose: </b>
                Deploy AI-powered solutions like Darktrace to continuously 
                monitor network traffic and detect deviations from normal 
                behavior. These tools use machine learning models to flag 
                unusual activities, such as unauthorized data transfers or 
                connections to unfamiliar domains. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5><b>Honeypots and Honeytokens :</b></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Tool: </b>
                CanaryTokens or Acalvio ShadowPlex 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Purpose: </b>
                Use deception-based tools like CanaryTokens to set traps 
                that alert administrators if accessed. Acalvio’s ShadowPlex 
                can deploy decoy servers, credentials, and applications to 
                detect attackers early and collect intelligence on their tactics. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5><b>Cyber Operation Legality:</b></h5>
    <p>The defensive approach uses tools like Azure Active Directory Conditional 
        Access to enforce Zero Trust principles, ensuring that every access request 
        is continuously verified. Darktrace or Vectra AI monitors network activity 
        in real time, identifying anomalies that may indicate an ongoing attack. 
        Finally, CanaryTokens or ShadowPlex deploy deceptive elements, providing an 
        early warning system while gathering intelligence on attackers.  </p>
