    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

    <p>
      In an era where digital landscapes shape global power dynamics, understanding and addressing cyber threats has become critical. 
      This website delves into Iran's comprehensive cyber warfare strategy, outlining the challenges, objectives, and key players 
      shaping the nation’s cyber defenses and offensive capabilities. Explore insights into operatives, threat groups, personnel 
      strategies, and Iran's overarching mission to secure and expand its influence in cyberspace.
    </p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>
      The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was established in April of 1979. 
      We have several cyber divisions operating under our name. The Electronic
       Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization (EWCD), the Intelligence 
       Organization (IO), Cyber-Electronic Command (CEC), and the Basij Cyber
        Council. We are led by Hossein Salami and operate under the Supreme leader.  
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The IRGC is committed to defending the Islamic Republic’s values, ideology,
      and sovereignty. In an era of rapidly evolving threats, we are at the front
      of defending Iran from adversaries who seek to undermine its sovereignty.
      The IRGC protects both the physical and digital boarders of Iran. In addition
      to defending our cyberspace, the IRGC’s offensive cyber capabilities enables 
      to deter and neutralize adversaries who attempt to harm our national 
      interests through cyber warfare.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      We have many talents working within our agency. We recruit anyone who 
      has the skills that can benefit our cause. Our espionage and sabotage 
      groups are in need of more operatives to help our mission. We may be in 
      competition with the Ministry of Intelligence; however, we do collaborate
      when needed. 
    </p>

        <p><b>Welcome to the Ministry of Intelligence and Security!</b></p>
        
        <p>
        Established in 1983, The Ministry of Intelligence is in charge
        of multiple cyber groups. Our leader is Esmaeil Khatib and we
        serve under the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. At the 
        Ministry of Intelligence, we are committed to protecting the 
        nation’s security and sovereignty.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            One of our many purposes is to collect, analyze, produce, 
            and categorize internal and external intelligence. MOIS 
            has played a crucial role in maintaining the stability 
            and integrity of the Islamic Republic by detecting and
            neutralizing both internal and external threats.
